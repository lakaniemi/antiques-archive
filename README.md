# Old projects

This repository is an archive of my old projects that I managed to find laying around on an old external HDD. Most of these I've created in my childhood, so they are not representative of my current coding skills :) 

## Projects

* [TUMG](/TUMG/): a project created in collaboration with a few members of the CoolBasic community back in the days. At this moment I already knew how to create games quite well using CoolBasic, but it's still not a masterpiece :D But probably one of the most finished projects I've managed to create with CoolBasic. I did all the coding, while others provided music & graphics.
* [Lolzeria](/lolzeria/): a [IRC-galleria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC-Galleria) wannebe clone I created with PHP as a child. This V2 version I created around 2009 (13 years old). Most of the code is mine, but some snippets are from the internet, from pages such as [ohjelmointiputka.net](https://www.ohjelmointiputka.net/). I also received help from my cousin (who also created all the graphics) and also from some CoolBasic community members :) The code is actually hilarious in some places, and of course most of it is in a single file.
