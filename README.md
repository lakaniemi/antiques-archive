# Old projects

This repository is an archive of my old projects that I managed to find laying around on an old external HDD. Most of these I've created in my childhood, so they are not representative of my current coding skills :) 

## Projects

* [TUMG](/TUMG/): a project created in collaboration with a few members of the CoolBasic community back in the days. At this moment I already knew how to create games quite well using CoolBasic, but it's still not a masterpiece :D But probably one of the most finished projects I've managed to create with CoolBasic. I did all the coding, while others provided music & graphics.
